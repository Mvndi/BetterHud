# BetterHud 1.9

## Notice
- Now support about 1.17, 1.17.1 and 1.18.1 is dropped.
- BetterHud and my other plugin does NOT support a closed or obfuscated source mod/plugin/modified-client such as ItemsAdder, Optifine and Feather.

## Resource pack merge
- If your server has Polymer, BetterHud's resource pack will automatically be merged. (Fabric)
- If your server has Oraxen, BetterHud's resource pack will automatically be merged. (Bukkit)

**Caution**
- Please set 'pack-type' in config.yml to 'none' if you want to use Polymer or Oraxen.
- If your server uses Polymer, you have to use '/polymer generate-pack' instead of '/hud reload'.
- If your server uses Oraxen, you have to use '/oraxen reload all' instead of '/hud reload'.

- Add 'line' to use multiple line text.
- Add 'line-width' to define the y location of each line.
- Add 'split-width' to define max length of each line.
- Add 'line-align' to sort each line.
- BetterHud uses '\n' to split text line.
