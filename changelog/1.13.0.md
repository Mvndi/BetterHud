# BetterHud 1.13.0

### Notice
Due to support 1.21.6 client, a significant change of resource pack structure has been worked.  
To update your BetterHud, you should delete BetterHud/shaders and execute reload to use a new shaders file.

A resource pack support of these resources is dropped.
- Oraxen—Because it has too outdated code and maintenance does not be in progress.
- Nexo—it is still closed-source, premium resource; can make significant issues about bug fix and compatibility check. 

### Add
- 1.21.6 client, server support
- Supports ARGB for HUD outline.
```yaml
#true = 0xFF000000, false = 0
outline: FF0026FF #blue with alpha 255
```

### Fix
- Closing http server properly
- Gets player's skin from player's name
- Int map usage

### Change
- Bumps most dependencies version.
